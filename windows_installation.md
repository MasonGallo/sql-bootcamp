# Windows Installation

### Installing MySQL Server and a client

- You will need administrative privileges!
- Download and install [mysql](http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQLInstaller/mysql-installer-community-5.7.12.0.msi)
- Accept all of the defaults in the installation and set your root password to `test` when it asks (don't ever do this on anything public-facing of course!)
- Download and install the trial for [sqlyog](https://www.webyog.com/product/downloads)

### Testing your installation

- Open SQLyog
- Click connect (if it isn't already showing)
- Click `New...`
- Name the connection whatever you want
- Make sure MySQL Host Address says `localhost` and username says `root`
- Enter the password that you used during installation
- Click connect!
