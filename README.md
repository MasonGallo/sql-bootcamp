# sql-bootcamp

This bootcamp will guide absolute beginners through the basics of SQL. 

# Before class

Be ready to learn and ready to make mistakes! Learning a new skill like SQL is
HARD, but we will walk through it together.

You are expected (and will learn better) to run and write queries on your own.

**This means you will need to install the following prior to class:**

- MySQL Server, serving as the "backend" for our SQL work
- A MySQL client, which will serve as the "frontend" for using with the server

**For installation instructions, follow the below for your OS:**

- [Mac OSX](/osx_installation.md)
- [Windows](/windows_installation.md)
- If you're using Linux as your main OS, chat with me if you need help :)

Note: All in-class examples will assume you followed the installation 
instructions to use MySQL. Unless you have a compelling reason, you should just
follow the instructions above. Other SQL dialects (SQLite, SQL Server) will 
work but may have slight differences. Access is strongly discouraged.
