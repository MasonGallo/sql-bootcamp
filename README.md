# sql-bootcamp

This bootcamp will guide absolute beginners through the basics of SQL. 

# Before class

Be ready to learn and ready to make mistakes! Learning a new skill like SQL is
HARD, but we will walk through it together.

You are expected (and will learn better) to run and write queries on your own.

**This means you will need to install some software in class:**

- Wagon, a SQL editor
- We will discuss other software depending on your individual learning plan

**For installation instructions, follow the below for Windows and macOS:**

- Go to the [Wagon](http://www.wagonhq.com/signup) page and sign up with your name and email
- You should get an email shortly from Team Wagon
- Click the create an account link in the email
- Create an account and put whatever you want for the team name...write these down because you will need them later
- You should get a link to download Wagon on either Mac or Windows
- If you're using Linux as your main OS, please chat with me :)

Note: installing the recommended software will ensure a much better experience this bootcamp. If you're not comfortable providing your email, please speak with me and we'll work something out!
